# JvWeather

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 9.1.7, performs weather queries on OpenWeather.org and has some functionality like:
* Possibility of saving your cities consulted on a Favorites page;
* Query with city suggestions to autocomplete, using an API simulation of cities from multiple countries;
* Query detail, displaying forecast for the next 7 days;

IN this project are applied knowledge such as:
* Bootstrap as a framework for CSS
* Lazy Loading;
* State Management using NgRx, a collection of libraries for reactive extensions;
* API consumption;
* Angular CDK for using Portals ("pieces of code" that provide a way to render dynamic content in specific parts of an application);
